# AdventOfCode2021
Solutions for AdventOfCode 2021, all 50 stars.

All written in beautiful single-file C# 10, with the help of the [Superpower](https://github.com/datalust/superpower) parsing library and, naturally, [MoreLINQ](https://github.com/morelinq/MoreLINQ).

Code quality takes a dip around Day 22, I ran out of free time.

## Running

To run any day:
```
dotnet run --project DAY
```
For example:
```
dotnet run --project DayThirteen
```
